    The month is October of 2019,  I'm working as a Grocery Manager for Tom Thumb.  Every week blending into the next, writing orders, building displays, dealing with cranky coworkers and customers.  Never knowing if the customer really bought an item, or is trying to scam the store for cash.  I had seen a future with the company until my mentor was denied a well deserved position.  Together, Him and I were slowly detailing the ways in which we could start our own companies, or improve the company we were working for. So began the idea for tracking every expiry date in the departments,  and the data that would come with such processes.  
		
		At the time, the department's dates were tracked by, and entered by hand monthly onto a terribly organized piece of paper.  I wouldn't want to check it that way, so how could I expect my staff to do it.  So I began my journey into Python starting with Sololearn, and then digging into the Python-Kivy framework for app development.  I spent my days at work, and nights working on my miscellaneous projects, even stepping down so I had more time to work on development.  Nearly two years into the future, I have a fully functional app with firebase integration for tracking the expiry dates.  Then came the self-doubt, how do you sell something with no proof of concept, how do you make people see things through your eyes when the only concern is money?  The answer was right in front of my eyes, data science.
