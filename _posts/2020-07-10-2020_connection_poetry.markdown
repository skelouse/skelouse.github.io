We are always connected,

	but all the more disconnected
	
double tap, 

you like the photo

	share your most prized motto
	
Exchange some vocabulary

	and tell her what you want to be
	
it's an alternate reality

neither undestanding the gravity

no look in their eye

	and no wave goodbye
	
this is not a connection,

	but it calls for some self reflection
